# TableMaster

Welcome to my new gem! TableMaster.

It is created with dynamically creating the tables and models in mind.

One of my friend said, he has a table of table_names that has specific relation to another table of table_names, in his case has_many relationship.

Or if you are creating multi-tenant application, you can create a group of tables on creating a new user and still able to access these tables with the Model class created on the fly.




## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'table_master'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install table_master
